## A Video Chat App - Web3RTC

It has been observed that people with different needs (work, social, school, etc.) seek different solutions to meet the increasing need for online meetings. Web3RTC is a video chat application built on completely decentralized technologies. It aims to establish connections between users without the need for any central server to store data or transmit media resources.

Web3RTC uses peer connections for both storing and transmitting operations:

**Store Operations** <br />
Authentication processes (register - login), creating and retrieving room data (participant list, chat messages etc.), storing and retrieving past meetings information, storing past meeting records, allowing to make changes for user preferences.

**Transmitting Media Source Operations** <br />
Establishing connection between peers in the rooms with both voice (source: microphone) and video (source: camera, screen share) sources.

Demo app can be found on the https://jade-sunburst-1968ce.netlify.app/
